        <li>2 cans coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>

        <li>4 tablespoons Dashida seasoning (or salt to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>donne' (hot pepper), optional</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>If you're using fresh green beans, you're going to want to blanch them first. In a large pot, bring about 5 cups of water to a rapid boil over high heat. Add enough salt so the water taste faintly salty. While the water heats, fill a medium sized bowl about three quarters full of ice, then add enough cold water to cover the top of the ice.</p>
        <p>When the water is boiling and the ice bath is ready, trim the green beans to the size you need. It's best to trim just prior to cooking so they wont oxidize or dehydrate. Add  the beans to the boiling water in batches small enough to ensure that the water doesn't lose it's boil. Boil the beans only until they're barely cooked through but still tender. To test, remove one piece with a slotted spoon, dip it into the ice bath to cool, and eat it.</p>
        <p>As soon as the beans are done, remove them as fast as you can and submerge them in the ice bath. Remove them from the ice bath as soon as they are no longer warm. Set aside.</p></li>
        <li>In a medium-sized pan, saute the meat, onions and garlic over medium high heat; cook until meat is brown and onions are translucent.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes to the meat mixture, juice and all.</li>
        <li>Add the blanched vegetables to the meat an tomatoes mixture.</li>
        <li>Add the Dashida and black pepper. Stir, taste, and adjust the seasonings if needed.</li>
        <li>Slowly stir in the coconut milk; lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes or until the coconut milk is heated (do not boil).</li>
        <li>Add donne' if desired. Serve over hot rice (steamed white or brown) and ENJOY!</li>
